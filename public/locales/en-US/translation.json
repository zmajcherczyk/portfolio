    "aboutMeDescription": "I graduated from Architecture and Urban Planning at the Cracow University of Technology. During my studies, I had the opportunity to study in Istanbul and Las Palmas. For 1.5 years I have been gaining experience as an interior designer in studio hex.\n My task was to create design documentation, moodboards, 3d models/visualizations, carry out inventory and help in the selection of materials.\n\n I find myself best in vintage style interiors. However, creating in a classic, rustic or modern style is also something I like to do. In architecture  I value minimalism, harmony with the surroundings and a well-thought-out selection of materials.\n\n Programs I work with: ArchiCAD, AutoCAD, LibreCAD, Adobe Photoshop, SketchUp + V-ray, 3ds Max + Corona.",
